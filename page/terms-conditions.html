<p><strong>PART 3: TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SUPPLY</strong></p>

<p>Part 3 of this page (together with any documents referred to in it) tells you the terms and conditions on which we supply the products (Products) listed on our site. Please read these terms and conditions carefully before ordering any Products from our site. You should understand that by ordering any of our Products, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. You should print a copy of these terms and conditions for future reference.</p>

<p><strong>Your status</strong></p>

<p>By placing an order through our site, you warrant that:</p>

<ul>
    <li>you are legally capable of entering into binding contracts; and</li>
    <li>you are at least 18 years old.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How the contract is formed between you and us</strong></p>

<p>After placing an order for a physical book, you will receive an e-mail from us acknowledging that we have received your order. Please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted. Your order constitutes an offer to us to buy a Product. All orders are subject to acceptance by us, and we will confirm such acceptance to you by sending you an e-mail that confirms that the Product has been despatched (Despatch Confirmation). The contract between us (Contract) will only be formed when we send you the Despatch Confirmation. The Contract will relate only to those Products whose despatch we have confirmed in the Despatch Confirmation. We will not be obliged to supply any other Products which may have been part of your order until the despatch of such Products has been confirmed in a separate Despatch Confirmation. You may cancel your order in relation to any physical book at any time before that product is despatched.</p>

<p><strong>Consumer rights</strong></p>

<p>If you are contracting as a consumer and you are resident within the European Union, you may cancel a Contract which relates to physical books at any time within seven working days, beginning on the day after you received the Products for any reason. In this case, you will receive a full refund of the price paid for the Products in accordance with our refunds policy. To cancel a Contract, you must inform us in writing. You must also return the Products to us as soon as reasonably practicable, and at your own cost. You have a legal obligation to take reasonable care of the Products while they are in your possession. If you fail to comply with this obligation, we may have a right of action against you for compensation. You will not have any right to cancel a Contract for the supply of content made available electronically. Details of your statutory right of cancellation, and an explanation of how to exercise it, are provided in the Despatch Confirmation. This provision does not affect your other statutory rights as a consumer.</p>

<p><strong>Availability and delivery</strong></p>

<p>In the case of physical books, your order will be fulfilled by the delivery date set out in the Despatch Confirmation or, if no delivery date is specified, then within 30 days of the date of the Despatch Confirmation, unless there are exceptional circumstances. Delivery will take place at your address for delivery provided to us when placing your order using a third-party carrier. Your sole remedy in the event of late delivery shall be to claim a refund in accordance our refunds policy (see below).</p>

<p><strong>Risk and title</strong></p>

<p>The Products will be at your risk from the time of delivery. Title will pass on delivery.</p>

<p><strong>Price and payment</strong></p>

<p>The price of the Products and our delivery charges will be as quoted on our site from time to time, except in cases of obvious error. Product prices and delivery charges are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect orders in respect of which we have already sent you a Despatch Confirmation. Our site contains a large number of Products and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Products listed on our site may be incorrectly priced. We will normally verify prices as part of our despatch procedures so that, where a Product&#39;s correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when despatching the Product to you. If a Product’s correct price is higher than the price stated on our site, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before despatching the Product, or reject your order and notify you of such rejection. We are under no obligation to provide the Product to you at the incorrect (lower) price, even after we have sent you a Despatch Confirmation, if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as an error. Payment for all Products must be by credit or debit card. Our service allows you to pay using Paypal or a wide range of credit and debit cards, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Visa Credit and Debit</li>
    <li>MasterCard</li>
    <li>Maestro</li>
    <li>Visa Electron</li>
    <li>American Express (on request)</li>
    <li>JCB</li>
    <li>Diners (on request)</li>
    <li>Laser</li>
    <li>ELV</li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of all Products, your payment will be processed at the time you place your order.</p>

<p><strong>Warranty</strong></p>

<p>We warrant to you that any physical book supplied will be in new condition and will comply in all material respects with the description given on our site.</p>

<p><strong>Our refunds policy</strong></p>

<p>If you return a physical book to us:</p>

<ul>
    <li>because you have cancelled the Contract between us within the seven-day cooling-off period (see above), we will process the refund due to you as soon as possible and, in any case, within 30 days of the day you gave notice of cancellation. In this case, we will refund the price of the Product in full, and any applicable delivery charges. However, you will be responsible for the cost of returning the item to us.</li>
    <li>for any other reason (for instance, because you consider that the Product is defective), we will examine the returned Product and will notify you of your refund, if appropriate, via e-mail within a reasonable period of time. We will usually process the refund due to you as soon as possible and, in any case, within 30 days of the day we confirmed to you via e-mail that you were entitled to a refund. We will refund the price of a defective Product in full, any applicable delivery charges and any reasonable costs you incur in returning the item to us.</li>

<p>Late delivery of physical books will not entitle you to a refund unless you have served a notice of cancellation prior to delivery in accordance with this paragraph. If we fail to deliver a physical book within 14 days of the delivery date, you may terminate your order in relation to that Product by serving a notice on us at info@toles.co.uk. Save as follows, we will refund the price of a physical book which we have failed to deliver in full, including any applicable delivery charges, usually within 30 days of your notification. If it is too late to recall the book from the courier, you must return the Product to us within 14 days of the date of delivery and your refund will be processed in accordance with the second bullet point of the preceding paragraph. This paragraph does not affect customers’ rights under the seven-day cooling off period (see above). We will usually refund any money received from you using the same method originally used by you to pay for your purchase.</p>

You will be responsible for payment of any such import duties and taxes. Please note that we have no control over these charges and cannot predict their amount. Please contact your local customs office for further information before placing your order. Please also note that you must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the country for which the products are destined. We will not be liable for any breach by you of any such laws.</p>

<p><strong>Written communications</strong></p>

<p>Applicable laws require that some of the information or communications we send to you should be in writing. When using our site, you accept that communication with us will be mainly electronic. We will contact you by e-mail or provide you with information by posting notices on our website. For contractual purposes, you agree to this electronic means of communication and you acknowledge that all contracts, notices, information and other communications that we provide to you electronically comply with any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. This condition does not affect your statutory rights.</p>

<p><strong>Notices</strong></p>

<p>All notices given by you to us must be sent to us at info@toles.co.uk. We may give notice to you at either the e-mail or postal address you provide to us when placing an order. Notice will be deemed received and properly served immediately when posted on our website, 24 hours after an e-mail is sent, or three days after the date of posting of any letter.

<p><strong>Transfer of rights and obligations</strong></p>

<p>The contract between you and us is binding on you and us and on our respective successors and assignees. You may not transfer, assign, charge or otherwise dispose of a Contract, or any of your rights or obligations arising under it, without our prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, charge, sub-contract or otherwise dispose of a Contract, or any of our rights or obligations arising under it, at any time during the term of the Contract.</p>

<p><strong>Events outside our control</strong></p>

<p>We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations under a Contract that is caused by events outside our reasonable control (Force Majeure Event). A Force Majeure Event includes any act, event, non-happening, omission or accident beyond our reasonable control and includes in particular (without limitation) the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>strikes, lock-outs or other industrial action;</li>
    <li>civil commotion, riot, invasion, terrorist attack or threat of terrorist attack, war (whether declared or not) or threat or preparation for war;</li>

    <li>impossibility of the use of public or private telecommunications networks; and</li>
    <li>the acts, decrees, legislation, regulations or restrictions of any government.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our performance under any Contract is deemed to be suspended for the period that the Force Majeure Event continues, and we will have an extension of time for performance for the duration of that period. We will use our reasonable endeavours to bring the Force Majeure Event to a close or to find a solution by which our obligations under the Contract may be performed despite the Force Majeure Event.</p>

<p><strong>Waiver</strong></p>

<p>If we fail, at any time during the term of a Contract, to insist upon strict performance of any of your obligations under the Contract or any of these terms and conditions, or if we fail to exercise any of the rights or remedies to which we are entitled under the Contract, this will not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies and will not relieve you from compliance with such obligations. A waiver by us of any default will not constitute a waiver of any subsequent default. No waiver by us of any of these terms and conditions will be effective unless it is expressly stated to be a waiver and is communicated to you in writing.</p>

<p><strong>Severability</strong></p>

<p>If any of these terms and conditions or any provisions of a Contract are determined by any competent authority to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, such term, condition or provision will to that extent be severed from the remaining terms, conditions and provisions which will continue to be valid to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>

<p><strong>Entire agreement</strong></p>

<p>These terms and conditions and any document expressly referred to in them constitute the whole agreement between us and supersede all previous discussions, correspondence, negotiations, previous arrangement, understanding or agreement between us relating to the subject matter of any Contract. We each acknowledge that, in entering into a Contract, neither of us relies on any representation or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in these terms and conditions or the documents referred to in them. Each of us agrees that our only liability in respect of those representations and warranties that are set out in this agreement (whether made innocently or negligently) will be for breach of contract. Nothing in this clause limits or excludes any liability for fraud.</p>

<p><strong>Our right to vary these terms and conditions</strong></p>

<p>We have the right to revise and amend these terms and conditions from time to time. You will be subject to the policies and terms and conditions in force at the time that you order products from us, unless any change to those policies or these terms and conditions is required to be made by law or governmental authority (in which case it will apply to orders previously placed by you), or if we notify you of the change to those policies or these terms and conditions before we send you the Despatch Confirmation (in which case we have the right to assume that you have accepted the change to the terms and conditions, unless you notify us to the contrary within seven working days of receipt by you of the Products).</p>

<p><strong>Law and jurisdiction</strong></p>

<p>Contracts for the purchase of Products through our site and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them or their subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) will be governed by English law. The English courts will have exclusive jurisdiction over any claim arising from, or related to, a visit to our site although we retain the right to bring proceedings against you for breach of these conditions in your country of residence or any other relevant country.</p>
